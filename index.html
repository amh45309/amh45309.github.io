  <h2>This is Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Angela. I am taking 18 hours, I play 2 intramural 
sports, I am in 6 clubs. I am a masochist. I like challenging myself 
however I did not realize what I was getting myself into. I am 
constantly on the verge of passing out. I turn in my assignments minutes
 before the dealine. I am just a ball of stress. </p>
 <p>
 I wish I could just cry
 it out but there are no more tears left in my body. But I am going to 
Europe for the whole summer, so I should have bomb *ss time there.
</p>
<p>
I am currently planning my summer acutally. It is the only thing getting me through this assignment. I am hoping to lan in Berlin, then go to Brussels, Barcelona, Porto, Paris, Saint Petersburg, Moscow, then Amsterdam.
